# Feedback and Term Paper Review
## Class Feedback
- Journal names should be abbreviated; Very clear to him that people did not follow the `How to Write a Good Paper` Document
- More quantitative data is better and more useful. Class relied to heavily on qualitative observations
- Figures should be used to enhance your work, don't just try to speak through words only. Readers are lazy and want to absorb information easily and have things to catch their eye. *In the real world, researchers are beginning to use a graphical abstract*
- Do not cite web addresses only! This is unacceptable in today's world, though this may change in the future
- People did not use consistent citation styles (Ishida hinted that he thought people used AI or non-credible sources to generate their citations, not good!)
- Cosmetic features and content are both important when it comes to writing and submitting papers
#### Grade Distribution of Class (low, avg, high): (60, 79.4, 100)
## Personal Feedback
- Good style and consistent reference citation style, but abbreviate journal names
- Reasonably good balance of qualitative and specific information, but if you add more quantitative information, the paper will be even more useful
- Good use of figures
- You need to add figure captions in addition to the figure number and citation information
- PPTA has a degradation temperature slightly below 600C. Hypersonic jet plane will experience skin temperature of 750-1000C. Thus, I doubt such a system will survive the temperature environment
- PDA is often used in muscle-mimetic adhesives, but it does not have high enough thermal stability to protect the interface under hypersonic conditions
#### Grade: 90%
