# Term Paper Information and Guide
## Introduction
### General Notes
1. Decide Vertical vs. Horizontal Approach
2. Published, peer-reviewed articles are expected
3. No date limit (old vs new articles) on citations, but you must read the entire article to be able to use it
### No-nos
- Do not cite web addresses as references, you need to choose and stick with a proper citation style
- Try to avoid writing a review article based on summarizing other review articles or book chapters alone. You may use review articles and book sections, but they should not dominate your references.
- Any more than 50 consecutive words that match a source is in violation of copyright law. Do not plagiarize ANYTHING. AI is strictly prohibited as well.
### Possible Term Paper Subjects
1. **Vitrimers**: A chemical group that can be broken apart under certain conditions, while having thermoset characteristics at room temp. Can be considered a dynamic bond. *Green mindset, improved recycling.*
2. **Green Flame Retardation**: Traditionally are highly or produce toxic chemicals when heated. Usually cancer causing. This paper should focus on developing one that isn't as toxic.
3. **Biowhiskers**: Making $mm\times nm$ crystals with no defects. This is desired as defects lead to reduced material strength. These are of bio origin and are biodegradable. *Example: Carbon Nanotubes: needle-like crystals which can be prepared from cellulose, kiting, or others.* 
4. **MXene**: Pronounced 'Max-ene'. Layers can be separated. THink of graphite which can be separated into individual layers of graphene. Have incredible aspect ratio.
5. **Glass Transition Temperature**: Super easy to measure. Popular topic of polymeric studies but not really known. How can we predict glass transition temperature without any assumptions? *Nobel Prize worthy in the field.*
6. **Collection of Rare Metals**: Naturals oil reserves are running out. Fracking is helping this but is horrible to the environment (contaminates water & worsens natural disasters). Metals are much harder to replace and we will run out of them before our oil reserves give out. *They are being found in low concentration in seawater...* 
7. **Porous Materials**: Used to assist in Topic #6. Very brittle/fragile but remarkably frame resistant. You can create non-metal catalysts with porous materials. *Example: Aerogels used on space shuttles.*
8. **Extreme Temperature Polymers**: Boeing Scramjet can fly in very thin air at fast speeds. Falcon HTV-2 also incredibly fast, compared to current record of Mach 3. Polymer needs to be developed to survive 750-1000C friction temps that is low density to allow safe, stable travel. *Used for weapons, but can turn into passenger travel $\to$ reduces trips to other continents to matters of hours.*
9. **Non-metallic Carbon Catalysts**: Related to Topic #7. Carbon's surface has defects $\to$ acts as catalytic centers. Can add to other atoms to increase number of defects and thus the catalyst is more effective.
10. **H-Bonding (Supramolecular Synthesis)**: Technique to let monomers contact a non-covalent manner and lets you selectively design polymerization, eliminating the usual randomness. Catalyst allows polymers to align in a desired way $\to$ crystalline properties. *Can align through H-bonding, and then you can apply desired polymerization.*
### Other Comments
- There is not a page minimum or maximum, the chosen subject will dictate the length of the paper you write.
- Outline & Rough Draft submissions are meant to keep you on track and act as forced checkpoints.
- Do not put it off until the last minute. The more you work on it over time the better your better will end up being.

## Reference Notes
I made use of BibTex to cite everything. This is simple to do as most accredited sources allows direct exporting of citations to BibTex, so you just have to pull out the information you need for each citation. Try to stick to the included sections below, but some journals don't include certain sections below, which is fine.
### ACS Reference Style
```BibTex
@article{Citation-Label,
	author = {},
	title = {},
	journal = {},
	year = {},
	volume = {},
	number = {},
	pages = {},
	doi = {}
}

@incollection{Citation-Label,
	author = {},
	title = {},
	booktitle = {},
	editor = {},
	publisher = {},
	year = {},
	pages = {},
	address = {}
}
```
Use `\citep{Citation-Label}` to cite the references in your paper.
